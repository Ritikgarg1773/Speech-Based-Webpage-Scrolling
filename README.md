# Speech-Based-Webpage-Scrolling
Ever wondered what it would be to direct your website completely with audio commands. From scrolling to opening link, to enlarging and clicking on images, to even possibility of changing and designing web pages even as we speak. This is what we began at Binary Blood. The current stage of speech based scrolling of a website which can be seen below. Credits to TalAlter for his wonderful speech recognition script ANNYANG.
Please help me out.
